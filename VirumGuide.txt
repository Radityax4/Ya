@Moderators

	You guys are responsible for dealing with any issues customers are having by adding the month they payed or adding them to the net if needed. 

	In order to add a new user, depending wether it is a vip user or a normal user, you are going to be relaying on 2 commands in order to do any of those things. 
		+.ADDBASIC
			[Adds normal user, don't forget to add cooldown!]
		+.ADDMEMBER
			[Adds a vip member with unlimited concurrents if you set 0 cooldown. Theres 3 types of resellers, depending on the seconds you'll add your new customer. 
			Example: 
			Member I: 1500 seconds 30 cooldown
			Member II: 4000 seconds 0 cooldown
			Member III: 10000 seconds 0 cooldown]

	Once a user is added if it needs to be removed for anything (Justified, example: violating rules) you will have the command
		+.REMOVEUSER [Removes users, if any reseller asks you to remove one of his customers you need to do it with proofs of why he is being removed]
	And for last but not least 
		+.ADDMONTH 
			[If a user expired and he payed his month again you can add his new mensuality]
